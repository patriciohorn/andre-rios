The torsoplasty, or back lift, is the surgery with which we remove the excess of skin in the upper back. It is an area that we can hardly improve much with only liposuction, in patients who have had a significant weight loss.

In some patients after losing a lot of weight, the skin on the upper back does not retract properly, leaving folds that are very difficult to remove without surgery. It is in these cases that this surgery can be used, alone or in combination with other procedures to improve the upper back region.

The surgery is performed with a cut that passes through the upper back, from side to side, and can be hidden, if used, in underwear or bathing suits.

**Type of anesthesia:** Epidural block and sedation.

**Duration:** 1-2 hrs.

**Recovery time:** 1-2 weeks

**_Important aspects of recovery:_**

-Most sutures do not have to be removed; the body reabsorbs them.

- In some cases, drains are left which are removed when they have a lower output (fluid output) of 30 ml per day.
- It is advisable to avoid straining and exercise for a minimum of 2-3 weeks to avoid wound complications.
- The final result takes between 2 and 3 months, however, from the end of the surgery, an important change can be noticed.

It is important to take care of the scars to prevent them from having a poor quality, taking care of them from the sun, friction and any irritation. Use sunblock daily.

- It is important to watch your diet after surgery (if you gain a lot of weight, the result may not be noticeable or subtle).
- Compression girdles are used for 24 hours for a minimum of 4 weeks.
