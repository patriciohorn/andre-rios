Mastopexy (breast lift) is a procedure with which we can reposition the breast tissue (skin, fat, and nipple) to achieve a better shape, and avoid the appearance of a sagging breast. The main element that makes a sagging breast look “saggy” is the position of the nipple in relation to the rest of the breast.

There are different techniques to perform a lift, depending on how much the nipple has to be raised. It can be done simply with the placement of an implant of variable size, with a cut around the nipple, or more commonly, making a cut with a result of an anchor or inverted T scar, which gives us a better result.

To know if your breast is sagging, or if you need a conservative or more radical surgery, a prior assessment is necessary, during which, together we will decide which approach is the right for you. In many cases, it may be suggested to use a small implant, along with skin resection, so that it has long-lasting support and firm the tissue, and that it maintains its shape for a longer time.

**Type of anesthesia:** Epidural block + sedation

**Duration:** 2-3 hr

**Recovery time: 1-2 weeks**

**_Important aspects of recovery:_**

– The sutures are removed after 7 days.

– A special compression bra is used, which is recommended to be used throughout the day for a minimum of 4 weeks after surgery, to provide support, reduce discomfort, reduce the risk of bleeding, keep the implant in position and limit inflammation.

– It is recommended a minimum of 3 weeks of not carrying things weighing more than 10 pounds, as well as avoiding raising the arms above the level of the shoulder as much as possible, this to avoid moving the implant from its position and maintaining an adequate shape.

– It is recommended that for 6 weeks, after surgery, exercises that put a lot of effort on the pectoral muscle be avoided (push-ups, barbell loading, even some back exercises), to avoid that the newly formed internal scar tears and causes bruising, implant displacement or internal bleeding.

– After a month and a half, normal life can be resumed gradually.

– The final result takes between 3 and 6 months, even so, the changes in the shape are noticeable immediately after the surgery.
