Reduction mammoplasty is a procedure with which we can reposition the breast tissue (skin, fat and nipple) to achieve a better shape, and at the same time reduce the size of the breast. In general, it is a surgery that is performed in patients with a lot of volume in the breast, which causes discomfort such as back pain, skin infections or that they simply do not like aesthetically.

The main technique for breast reduction, results in an anchor or inverted T scar, giving a better aesthetic final result. At the end of the day, it is best to go to an assessment to define if the best procedure in your case is just a reduction or reduction with an implant, and thus make the best decision.

**Type of anesthesia:** Epidural block + sedation

**Duration:** 2-3 hr

**Recovery time: 1-2 weeks**

**_Important aspects of recovery:_**

**_–_** The sutures are removed after 7 days.

– A special compression bra is used, which is recommended to be worn throughout the day for a minimum of 4 weeks after surgery, to provide support, reduce discomfort, reduce the risk of bleeding and limit inflammation.

– It is recommended a minimum of 3 weeks of not carrying things weighing more than 10 pounds, as well as avoiding raising the arms above the level of the shoulder as much as possible, this to avoid moving the implant from its position and maintaining an adequate shape, in case an implant is used.

– It is recommended that for 6 weeks, after surgery, exercises that put a lot of effort on the pectoral muscle be avoided (push-ups, barbell loading, even some back exercises), to avoid that the newly formed internal scar tears and causes bruising, implant displacement or internal bleeding, in case an implant is used.

– After a month, normal life can be resumed gradually.

– The final result takes between 3 and 6 months, even so, the changes in the shape are noticeable immediately after the surgery.
