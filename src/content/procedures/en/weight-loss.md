Patients with massive weight loss are those who have lost more than 20 kg or 50 lbs, generally in short periods of time (less than 6 months), either through a diet or after bariatric surgery.

By having such significant losses in fat volume, generally the skin does not have enough elasticity to fully retract and fit tightly over the different areas of the body, leaving it flaccid and creating folds in the skin, which we can remove through surgery.

The areas that are most commonly affected are: abdomen, breast, back, arms, thighs and face. Therefore, combinations of surgeries at different times may be necessary to correct all the areas that the patient wishes to improve or that have been affected.

During the evaluation consultation we will see which surgeries are appropriate to improve the areas that you want to treat.
