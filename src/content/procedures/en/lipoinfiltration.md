Fat infiltration (lipoinfiltration) is the procedure with which we use the fat that we obtain through liposuction, to modify the shape and volume in different areas of the body.

It is generally used to increase volume and shape the buttocks, however, it is also used very frequently on the hips, breast and face (cheekbones and chin), as well as in cases of liposuction with high definition (HD), it can be used to give greater definition in areas such as pectorals (chest) and deltoids (shoulder), among others.

The technique I use is not the conventional one used by most surgeons who perform infiltration. While obtaining the fat, a lot of water and blood are obtained, which most surgeons decant, and inject fat even with a very high percentage of liquid, which is why it is a very fluid fat, that’s why you must take care not to apply pressure, since it can migrate from its place of infiltration, in addition to the fact that since a very important part is water, a much greater amount of the volume with which we finish the surgery is absorbed.

My technique consists in that after separating the fat, centrifugation is carried out at low speeds for short periods of time, to separate the water, blood and remaining oil, from the living fat cells, which is why when injected, it is a fat much more solid, which gives much better projection and volume, survives in a higher percentage and is not affected as much by changes in position (lying down, sitting down, etc.).

**Type of anesthesia:** The one performed during liposuction surgery (usually Epidural Block and sedation).

**Duration:** Depending on the areas to work and the marking.

**Recovery time:** 1-2 weeks

**_Important aspects of recovery:_**

- The sutures are removed in about 5-7 days.
- In cases with abdominal or lower back lipo, drains are left which are removed when they have a lower output (fluid output) of 30 ml per day.
- The swelling is accentuated the first 5-7 days after surgery, persists for a further 1-2 weeks, and then gradually begins to decrease.
- The fat initially feels very hard, with a consistency almost like clay, however, as time passes by, it ends up being a fat with a feeling equal to that of the body.
- During recovery, when there is inflammation, it is a good idea to watch out of the sun so that your skin does not stain.
- The final result takes between 6 and 12 months, however, from the second to third week a change in shape can be observed.
- It is important to watch your diet after surgery (if you gain a lot of weight, the result may not be noticeable or it may be very subtle).
- Compression girdles are used for 24 hours for a minimum of 4 weeks, except when taking a shower.
