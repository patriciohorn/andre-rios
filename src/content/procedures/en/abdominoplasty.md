Abdominoplasty or Tummy tuck is the surgery with which we can remove excess skin in patients who after a considerable weight loss, or several pregnancies, have loose or excess skin around the abdomen area.

During this surgery, small hernias and weakness of the muscles of the abdomen can also be repaired, which in many cases is what prevents an abdomen from looking flat. It is not a procedure to improve the contour, we achieve that with liposculpture, so if your goal, in addition to removing excess skin, is to improve the silhouette and remove localized fat, they can be done together. However, this is not a rule, it all depends on the desired result. In addition to the abdomen in some cases, we can lift the lateral part of the thighs, the pubis and the buttocks, when they look saggy, especially in patients with massive weight loss.

In some patients with excess skin in the upper abdomen, the excess skin will have to be removed below the breasts, hiding the scar in the crease between the bust and the abdomen, which can be perfectly hidden with underwear.

The surgery is performed with a smile-shaped cut in the lower abdomen, which is hidden with underwear or even a 2-piece bathing suit. The extent of the surgery depends on how much excess skin you have, and it can be placed only in the lower abdomen area, be extended to the back, or even going all the way around.

**Type of anesthesia:** Epidural block and sedation.

**Duration:** 3 hrs.

**Recovery time:** 2-3 weeks

**_Important aspects of recovery:_**

- Most sutures do not have to be removed; the body reabsorbs them.
- In most cases, drains are left which are removed when they have a lower output (fluid output) of 30 ml per day.
- The extent of the scar depends on each patient.
- It is advisable to avoid exercise using the abdominal muscles for 2-3 months to have an excellent functional recovery of the abdomen.
- The final result takes between 2 and 3 months, however, from the end of the surgery, an important change can be noticed. If combined with liposuction, the final result may take longer to arrive.
- It is important to watch your diet after surgery (if you gain a lot of weight, the result may not be noticeable or it may be very subtle).
- Compression girdles are used for 24 hours for a minimum of 4 weeks, except when taking a shower.
