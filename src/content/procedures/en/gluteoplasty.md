Gluteoplasty is the surgery with which we improve the shape and volume of the buttock, in this case, using the latest generation of silicone implants. Implants are preferred over fat in cases of patients who are too thin, when we do not have enough fat to infiltrate, or simply for patients that want to have a stable and more projected buttock shape with less fat.

There are “hybrid” augmentations that create the best results, that is, in patients who require gluteal implants, we use fat to refine the shape and balance of the volume, for a more natural appearance, than with the use of implants alone.

The surgery is performed through incisions that go inside the crease between the buttocks, which are perfectly hidden with underwear or bathing suits. Two incisions are made to avoid complications due to excess tension in the wound, of approximately 2 inches.

**Type of anesthesia:** Epidural block and sedation.

**Duration:** 1-2 hrs.

**Recovery time:** 2-3 weeks

**_Important aspects of recovery:_**

- The sutures are removed after around 2 weeks to avoid wound complications.
- Drains are left which are removed when they have a lower output (fluid output) of 30 ml per day.
- It is an uncomfortable surgery, so it is recommended to sleep on your stomach and avoid sitting during the first days after the surgery.
- _After gluteal implant placement, injections should no longer be given in this area for life._
- In case of pain, we can use medications to better control it, or skin patches.
- The final result takes between 3 and 6 months, however, from the immediate postoperative period the change in volume and shape is observed.
- It is important to watch your diet after surgery (if you gain a lot of weight, the result may not be noticeable or it may be very subtle).
