Augmentation mammoplasty (breast augmentation) with implants is the surgery with which we improve the shape and volume of the breast, to achieve that result that women like so much. There are different techniques and considerations that we must have when choosing the implant, which depends MAINLY on the measurements of the patient’s body.

How much volume is the best or ideal? This is one of the main questions or doubts that some patients ask me and the answer is that together, during your evaluation, we will determine which volume is right for you, depending on the results you want and the size of your body. What do I mean by your body size? An implant of any size will not look the same in a tall woman than a short one, or a woman with a slightly wider back to a slim one. It is a very common mistake to think that the same volume of implant gives the same result for all patients. That is why it is important to define what you are looking for in your surgery and translate that into what type of implant is the best for you.

Speaking about the surgery, it can be performed through different approaches, depending on the results that you want and the shape of your breast. Generally, a small cut of less than 2 inches is made in the breast fold (lower part), through which a silicone implant is inserted. Implant shape and size, texture, placement, and approach are thoroughly discussed during your evaluation.

Type of anesthesia: Epidural block + Sedation

Duration: 1 hr

Recovery time: 5-7 days

Important aspects of recovery:

– The sutures are removed after 7 days.

– A special compression bra is used, which is recommended to be used throughout the day for a minimum of 4 weeks after surgery, to provide support, reduce discomfort, reduce the risk of bleeding, keep the implant in position and limit inflammation.

– It is recommended a minimum of 3 weeks of not carrying things weighing more than 10 pounds, as well as avoiding raising the arms above the level of the shoulder as much as possible, this to avoid moving the implant from its position and maintaining an adequate shape.

– It is recommended that for 6 weeks, after surgery, exercises that put a lot of effort on the pectoral muscle be avoided (push-ups, barbell loading, even some back exercises), to avoid that the newly formed internal scar tears and causes bruising, implant displacement, or internal bleeding.

– After a month and a half, normal life can be resumed gradually.

– The final result takes between 3 and 6 months, even so, the changes in the shape are noticeable immediately after the surgery.
