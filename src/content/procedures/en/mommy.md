The Mommy Makeover is a combination of procedures that focuses on improving the two main affected areas in women who have had pregnancies: the abdomen and the breast. Due to changes that occur during pregnancy, these areas are generally left with flaccid skin, sometimes with stretch marks, and most of the times, there may be a separation of the abdominal muscles that causes the abdomen to look round and feel weak.

Generally, liposuction, tummy tuck, breast augmentation (with or without implants) and / or breast lift are combined, it all depends on the skin conditions, the fat in these areas and the desired result.

Each patient is different, both in their body shape, skin, fat volume and very important also in the results or goals they have with their surgery, so it is ideal to carry out an evaluation with your surgeon in order to plan a surgery more focused on your needs.

**Type of anesthesia:** It depends on the procedures to be performed (generally it is an epidural block and sedation).

**Duration:** Variable.

**Recovery time: 2-3 weeks.**

**_Important aspects of recovery:_**

- Most sutures do not have to be removed; the body reabsorbs them.

In case you have sutures that need to be removed, Dr. Rios will indicate when they should be removed.

- In some cases, drains are left which are removed when they have a lower output (fluid output) of 30 ml per day.
- It is advisable to avoid exertion and exercise for a minimum of 2-3 weeks to avoid wound complications.
- The final result takes between 3 and 6 months in the breast, and 6 to 9 months in the body, however, from the end of the surgery an important change can be noticed.
- It is important to take care of the scars to prevent them from having a poor quality, taking care of them from the sun, friction and any irritation.
- It is important to watch your diet after surgery (if you gain a lot of weight, the result may not be noticeable or subtle).
- Compression girdles are used for 24 hours for a minimum of 4 weeks.
