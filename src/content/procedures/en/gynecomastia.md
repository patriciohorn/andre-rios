Gynecomastia surgery focuses on improving the chest area in men who have increased glandular or fat volume, and are uncomfortable with it. There are many causes that can lead to an increase in fat or mammary gland volume in men, and that can give a feminine appearance to the chest area.

Initially, we can try to find the cause of the increase in volume, however, in many cases no factor is found that can be removed or avoided, in these cases, the surgery removes the excess volume of fat or gland, to give a better appearance to the breast.

The surgery generally consists of performing liposuction of the chest, however, in some cases it is necessary to make cuts to remove excess gland behind the nipple, or even remove skin when there is an excess of it.

**Type of anesthesia:** Epidural block and sedation.

**Duration:** 1-2 hrs.

**Recovery time:** 1-2 weeks.

**_Important aspects of recovery:_**

- Most sutures do not have to be removed; the body reabsorbs them.
- In some cases, drains are left which are removed when they have a lower output (fluid output) of 30 ml per day.
- It is advisable to avoid straining and exercise for a minimum of 2-3 weeks to avoid wound complications.
- The final result takes between 3 and 6 months, however, from the end of the surgery, an important change can be noticed.
- It is important to take care of the scars to prevent them from having a poor quality, taking care of them from the sun, friction and any irritation. Use sunblock and hydrate, on daily basis, after 1-2 weeks of your surgery.
- It is important to watch your diet after surgery (if you gain a lot of weight, the result may not be noticeable or subtle).
- Compression girdles are used for 24 hours for a minimum of 4 weeks, only removing them for showers.
